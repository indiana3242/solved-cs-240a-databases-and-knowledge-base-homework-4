Question 2Many airports use a complex conveyor system to deliver luggage to their destination. Some pieces of luggage end up going around in a cyclic pattern. We have sensors at each location producing a sequence: events(itemNo; SensorNo; SensorType; Time) You must write a query to detct items that are going around in a cycle, i.e., they have returned to the same location within one day. Many objects do not move fast, so the sensor might produce consecutive readings of the same object even if this is not in a cycle. Express your query using the proposed new SQL standards.
